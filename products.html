<center><b2 style=”text-align: center; font-size: 12pt; color: black; font-family: Times New Roman;”> Please arrive to your scheduled visit wearing comfortable clothing: a t-shirt, jacket or windbreaker, closed-toe shoes, & thick socks. DO NOT wear clothes that restrict your movement. Regardless of the daily temperatures, we suggest a few layers of clothing as wind and high altitudes can create an uncomfortably cold experience.</b2></center>
